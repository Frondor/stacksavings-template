## One night - HTML5 template

A simple template built as a trial task to a job position :muscle:. Seizing the oportunity to practice my rusty design skills, and to try bootstrap 4 for first time.

The project is using Vue cli to quickly scaffold a development environment with a build system (webpack) and hot-reload for web components.

<blockquote>Made in one night, hence its name</blockquote>

## To do

 - [x] <s>Base layout in plain bootstrap</s>
 - [ ] Apply the theme style
 - [ ] Add modals and animations
 - [ ] Build stand-alone version (without Vue)
